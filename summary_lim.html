        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, we learned that there really is not one singular way to define what makes a song popular.
          Different genres have different trends when it comes to audio features and popularity. Although people across the World
          have different tastes our visualizations showed us that there are still some common patterns in the kinds of songs listeners respond to.
          At the same time, each genre has its own style, which means what works for one genre may not work for another. This project helped us better understand
          the wide range of components that go into making tracks succesful. We saw that many popular tracks share traits like higher energy or stronger rhythm, even though 
          musical patterns vary by genre. Our charts also showed that popularity is spread differently across genres, with some having high peaks and others showing more variation. 
          Overall, analyzing these trends helped us see that popularity depends on both listener preferences and the unique characteristics of each genre. We also learned that some genres have consistent popularity among tracks while others rely on a smaller range of
          standout or hit songs to reach high popularity scores. Analyzing the full dashboard helped to explain why many artists produce
          in genres like pop and hip hop because these genres showed the most consistent popularity and strongest alighnment with 
          features that listeners respond well to. Music behavior and success can be influenced by many factors as shown in our analysis, and while we can see certain patterns that contribute to popular music, 
          it is still difficult to reach a concrete answer because of people’s taste, changing trends, and the way listeners access different types of music.

          For future work, it would be interesting to expand the dataset to include more mid-level popularity tracks
          to see if there are more gradual trends that emerge. Additionally, incorporating user listening data
          and demographic information could provide deeper insights into how different audiences engage with music.
          Finally, applying machine learning techniques to predict track popularity based on audio features
          could be a valuable extension of this analysis similar to the one reference article we found in our proposal.

        <h2>Data Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          One limitation of our data is that it came solely from Spotify and therefore only represents the listening habits of Spotify users, most of whom are based in the United States. 
          Because the platform’s largest user base is dominated by people in the U.S., the trends we observed likely reflect American listening preferences more strongly than 
          any other countries. This can skew our analysis toward genres and audio features that are popular in the U.S. while underrepresenting patterns from regions where Spotify is less widely used. 
          As a result, our findings cannot fully capture the musical tastes of the entire world and only those of spotify users in the regions where spotify is most used. 
          <br>Another limitation is that our dataset only included high- and low-popularity tracks, leaving out the large group of mid-popularity songs. Without this middle range, 
          we may be missing more gradual patterns that could show how songs move from average to highly popular.
